    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Hi, I'm Jimmy.</strong> I'm a former Active Duty U.S. Navy Sailor with
      six years of honorable service. Near the end of my contract, I discovered
      programming, and it quickly became a passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the past several months, I've spent countless hours building projects
      and learning by doing. I've worked on everything from
      <strong>stock market simulations in Pygame</strong> to
      <strong>making custom toolsets</strong> in new and unique environments,
      as well as web development projects like this one.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm actively seeking <em>internships, entry-level roles, or training
      opportunities</em> where I can continue to grow as a developer.
      I'm motivated, disciplined, and eager to learn.
    </p>

      <h3>IP Camera Security Analysis (Home Lab)</h3>
      <p><em>Embedded systems security analysis and reverse engineering</em></p>

      <div class="project-split">
        <img src="art/ptz_cam.jpg" class="project-image" alt="Hand holding IP camera lightbulb">
        <img src="art/disassembled.jpg" class="project-image" alt="PTZ IP camera internals">

      </div>

      <p>
        This ongoing home lab focuses on analyzing the security posture of a consumer IP camera
        from both an attacker and defender perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
        Initial analysis focused on understanding how the device is accessed during normal operation.
        Using <strong>Wireshark</strong> and <strong>Kali Linux</strong>, I inspected network traffic generated
        by the mobile companion application. This revealed that the camera is
        <strong>not accessed directly by the mobile app</strong>; instead, the app communicates with a
        remote cloud service that authenticates the user and brokers access to the camera feed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because the camera relied on a cloud-mediated control path rather than direct local access,
        I shifted focus to services exposed by the device itself. Network service enumeration
        identified an active <strong>Telnet service</strong>, which appeared to operate independently
        of the cloud authentication flow and therefore represented a significantly softer local
        attack surface.
      </p>
      <p>
        To investigate authentication behavior further, I physically accessed the device, identified
        the flash chip and used a <strong>logic analyzer</strong> to dump the firmware directly from
        the board. The extracted image was analyzed in <strong>Ghidra</strong> to examine how network
        services and credentials were implemented internally.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the firmware was compressed using a proprietary format, this limitation led to
        identifying an additional attack surface: exposed <strong>UART pins</strong> on the PCB.
        The next phase involves interfacing with UART to assess boot-time output, console access,
        and potential privilege escalation paths.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project has strengthened my understanding of
        <strong>IoT communication models</strong> and <strong>embedded attack surfaces</strong>.

      <h3>Pygame Stock Market Simulation</h3>
      <p><em>A data-driven stock market simulator with real-time price and volume modeling</em></p>

      <video src="media/stock-game.mp4" autoplay muted loop playsinline></video>

      <p>
        This project significantly deepened my understanding of
        <strong>object-oriented programming</strong> and the importance of
        well-structured, maintainable data systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Early on, I faced challenges managing a large JSON-based data schema
        containing roughly <strong>2,000 data points per stock</strong>, including
        simulated volume, OHLC data, and real-time price updates.
      </p>
      <p>
        As complexity increased, JSON I/O became a performance bottleneck.
        Recognizing this, I refactored the data layer to use
        <strong>SQLite</strong>, designing a schema optimized for frequent reads
        and writes. This change significantly improved performance and scalability.

      <h3>Modular Crafting &amp; Sprite Generation System</h3>
      <p><em>A procedural weapon crafting and sprite generation prototype built in Python</em></p>

      <video src="media/blacksmith-game.mp4" autoplay muted loop playsinline></video>

      <p>
        I began this project by applying lessons learned from my simulation work,
        particularly around <strong>class design</strong> and
        <strong>modular architecture</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This led to a dynamic sprite generation system paired with shape-based
        crafting logic. A dedicated object factory generates thematically
        consistent weapons based on selected materials and their elemental
        properties.
      </p>
      <p>
        These attributes influence both visual components and procedurally
        generated prefix and suffix names, significantly reducing manual asset
        creation and saving development time.

      <h3>Steezus - A Retro Smart Home Controller</h3>
      <p><em>A Pygame-based smart home control panel with a retro 80s aesthetic</em></p>

        <img src="images/demo_2.png" class="project-image" alt="Retro API key entry screen">
      </div>

      <p>
        This project integrates the <strong>Govee REST API</strong> to discover and control
        real smart home devices through a fully custom Pygame interface — no web browser, no
        third-party dashboard. The entire UI is hand-built inside a Pygame render loop.
      </p>
      <p>
        On first launch, an API key entry screen collects credentials and saves them locally
        (git-ignored). The app then queries the Govee <code>/v1/devices</code> endpoint and
        passes the response through a <strong>DeviceFactory</strong> that constructs typed
        <strong>SmartDevice</strong> objects for every device on the account — keeping the
        API layer cleanly separated from the UI.
      </p>
      <p>
        The interface divides into a device sidebar and a command panel, with a VHS bitmap font
        and scanline-era styling throughout. This project pushed my understanding of
        <strong>API integration</strong>, <strong>object-oriented design</strong>,
        and building polished, self-contained desktop applications from scratch.

      <h3>Glitch Editor - A Live Visual Effects Studio</h3>
      <p><em>A real-time image, video, and webcam editor with a timeline-based effects pipeline built on OpenCV</em></p>

      <div class="project-split">
        <img src="images/screenshot_ui.png" class="project-image" alt="Video editing software UI screenshot">
        <img src="images/output_with_effects_0.png" class="project-image" alt="Facial recognition with effects applied">
      </div>

      <p>
        This project is a live visual effects tool that applies
        <strong>OpenCV-powered filters and distortions</strong> to still images, video files,
        or a live webcam feed in real time. Effects can be stacked and sequenced using a
        <strong>timeline system</strong>, giving the user precise control over when each
        transformation activates.
      </p>
      <p>
        Building the timeline required designing a small scheduling layer on top of the
        OpenCV frame pipeline, each effect is treated as a discrete, time-bound operation
        that the renderer steps through frame by frame. This forced careful thinking around
        <strong>state management</strong> and keeping processing overhead low enough to
        maintain a responsive feed.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project deepened my understanding of <strong>real-time frame processing</strong>,
        computer vision tooling, and building systems where timing and throughput directly
        affect user experience.

      <h3>Tactical Isometric Tile Engine </h3>
      <p><em>A performant, systems-driven battlefield engine built from the ground up in Python</em></p>

      <video src="media/ttrpg-game.mp4" autoplay muted loop playsinline></video>

      <p>
        This project is a major evolution of my earlier tile-based experiments,
        focused on building a <strong>scalable, real-time procedural rendering pipeline</strong>
        suitable for tactical and strategy gameplay.
      </p>
      <p>
        The engine procedurally renders a large isometric battlefield composed of layered tiles
        and dynamic entities. A custom camera system supports smooth panning, zooming, and precise
        screen-to-world interaction.
      </p>
      <p>
        To address performance constraints, I implemented aggressive <strong>viewport culling</strong>,
        minimized redundant draw calls, and refactored rendering logic into tightly scoped systems.
        These changes resulted in a significant FPS improvement while maintaining visual clarity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond rendering, the engine integrates grid-based movement, action dispatching, and a modular
        battle architecture designed to support turn-based combat, abilities, and future AI behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project reflects my current approach to development: designing systems with
        <strong>clear responsibilities, measurable performance goals, and long-term extensibility</strong>.
