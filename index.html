    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi, I’m Jimmy.</strong> I’m a former Active Duty U.S. Navy Sailor with
      six years of honorable service. Near the end of my contract, I discovered
      programming - and it quickly became a passion.
    </p>

    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past several months, I’ve spent countless hours building projects
      and learning by doing. I’ve worked on everything from
      <strong>stock market simulations in Pygame</strong> to
      <strong>training machine-learning agents</strong> in custom environments,
      as well as web development projects like this one.
    </p>

    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’m actively seeking <em>internships, entry-level roles, or training
      opportunities</em> where I can continue to grow as a developer.
      I’m motivated, disciplined, and eager to learn.
    </p>

      <h3>Pygame Stock Market Simulation</h3>
      <p><em>A data-driven stock market simulator with real-time price and volume modeling</em></p>

      <video src="media/stock-game.mp4"  autoplay muted loop playsinline></video>

      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project significantly deepened my understanding of
        <strong>object-oriented programming</strong> and the importance of
        well-structured, maintainable data systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        Early on, I faced challenges managing a large JSON-based data schema
        containing roughly <strong>2,000 data points per stock</strong>, including
        simulated volume, OHLC data, and real-time price updates.
      </p>

      <p>
        As complexity increased, JSON I/O became a performance bottleneck.
        Recognizing this, I refactored the data layer to use
        <strong>SQLite</strong>, designing a schema optimized for frequent reads
        and writes. This change significantly improved performance and scalability.

      <h3>Modular Crafting & Sprite Generation System</h3>
      <p><em>A procedural weapon crafting and sprite generation prototype built in Python</em></p>

      <video src="media/blacksmith-game.mp4"  autoplay muted loop playsinline></video>

      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I began this project by applying lessons learned from my simulation work,
        particularly around <strong>class design</strong> and
        <strong>modular architecture</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        This led to a dynamic sprite generation system paired with shape-based
        crafting logic. A dedicated object factory generates thematically
        consistent weapons based on selected materials and their elemental
        properties.
      </p>

      <p>
        These attributes influence both visual components and procedurally
        generated prefix and suffix names, significantly reducing manual asset
        creation and saving development time.

      <h3>Experimental Tile-Based World Renderer</h3>
      <p><em>An early prototype built with FreeSimpleGUI</em></p>

      <video src="media/clicker-game.mp4"  autoplay muted loop playsinline></video>

      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This experimental prototype pushed me to think creatively about
        <strong>performance constraints</strong> and system design.
        I implemented a functional overworld traversal system using FreeSimpleGUI
        a library not intended for real-time rendering.
      </p>

      <p>
        The world was defined as an ASCII grid, with characters mapped to tile
        sprite paths. On first load, the entire map was dynamically composed into
        a single PNG image and cached for reuse.
      </p>

      <p>
        While I would approach this differently today, the project taught me
        valuable lessons about performance bottlenecks, asset management,
        caching strategies, and working within tool constraints.

      <h3>Tactical Isometric Tile Engine (In Development)</h3>
      <p><em>A performant, systems-driven battlefield engine built from the ground up in Python</em></p>

      <video src="media/ttrpg-game.mp4" autoplay muted loop playsinline></video>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project is a major evolution of my earlier tile-based experiments,
        focused on building a <strong>scalable, real-time procedural rendering pipeline</strong> suitable for
        tactical and strategy gameplay.
      </p>

      <p>
        The engine renders a large isometric battlefield composed of layered tiles, elevation steps,
        and dynamic entities. A custom camera system supports smooth panning, zooming, and precise
        screen-to-world interaction.
      </p>

      <p>
      To address performance constraints, I implemented aggressive <strong>viewport culling</strong>,
      minimized redundant draw calls, and refactored rendering logic into tightly scoped systems.
      These changes resulted in a significant FPS improvement while maintaining visual clarity.
      </p>

    <p>
      Beyond rendering, the engine integrates grid-based movement, action dispatching, and a modular
      battle architecture designed to support turn-based combat, abilities, and future AI behavior.
    </p>

    <p>
      This project reflects my current approach to development: designing systems with
      <strong>clear responsibilities, measurable performance goals, and long-term extensibility</strong>.
