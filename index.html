          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>Hi, I’m Jimmy. I’m a former Active Duty U.S. Navy Sailor with six years of honorable service. Near the end of my contract, I discovered programming—and it quickly became a passion.
            Over the past several months, I’ve spent countless hours building projects and learning by doing. I’ve worked on everything from stock market simulations in Pygame to training machine-learning agents in custom environments, as well as web development projects like this one.
            I’m actively seeking internships, entry-level roles, or training opportunities where I can continue to grow as a developer. I’m motivated, disciplined, and eager to learn.

            <p>This project significantly deepened my understanding of object-oriented programming and the importance of well-structured, maintainable data systems. One of the main challenges I encountered early on was managing a large JSON-based data schema containing roughly 2,000 data points per stock, including simulated volume, open, high, low, close, and real-time price updates.
            As the simulation grew more complex, the overhead of reading from and writing to JSON became a performance bottleneck. Recognizing this early, I refactored the project’s data layer to use SQLite, designing a more efficient schema optimized for frequent reads and writes. This change significantly reduced overhead and allowed the simulation to scale more reliably in real time.

            <p>
             I began this project after applying lessons learned from my simulation work, particularly around class design and modular architecture. From the outset, I focused on keeping systems as decoupled and reusable as possible, which led to the development of a dynamic sprite generation system paired with shape-based crafting logic.

            This modular approach made it straightforward to introduce an object factory responsible for generating thematically consistent weapon sprites. The factory accounts for selected materials and their intrinsic elemental properties, using those attributes to determine both visual components and procedurally generated prefix and suffix names. This design significantly reduced manual asset creation and saved substantial development time.

            <h3>Experimental Tile-Based World Renderer</h3>
            <h4><em>An early prototype built with FreeSimpleGUI</em></h4>

            src="media/clicker-game.mp4"

            <p>This project was an early experimental prototype that pushed me to think creatively about systems and performance constraints. I implemented a functional overworld tile traversal system using FreeSimpleGUI a library not intended for real-time map rendering or game-style interaction.

The world was defined as an ASCII grid, where individual characters mapped to tile sprite file paths. On first load, the system dynamically composed the full map into a single PNG image to address the significant overhead of loading many individual assets at runtime. This generated map was then cached and reused on subsequent loads, drastically improving performance when re-entering the overworld.

While I would approach this problem differently today, this project taught me valuable lessons about performance bottlenecks, asset management, caching strategies, and working within and sometimes around the constraints of a chosen toolset.</p>
